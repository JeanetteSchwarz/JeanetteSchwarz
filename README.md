# Welcome to my Github 🖖
I am a Journalist who want's to reach out for something **new**. Within the last year I decided to leave journalism for a while and try to become a developer. I joined the _neuefische_ Web-Developement-Bootcamp in January 2024 and I am really looking forward to learn how to code. 👩🏻‍💻

Things I like:
- Cats
- Yoga
- Travel
- Reading crime storys
- Cook
